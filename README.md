## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This visualizer helps you understand:
- **How different coroutine types behave** with visual animations
- **When to use each coroutine pattern** with real-world examples
- **Step-by-step execution flow** with detailed logging
- **Thread switching** and context management
- **Flow types** (Cold, Hot, Shared, State) differences

## 🚀 Features

### 📱 Interactive Animations
- **Real-time visualization** of coroutine execution
- **Step-by-step logging** showing exactly what happens
- **Individual controls** for each coroutine type
- **Visual flow tracking** with emissions and collectors

### 🎓 Educational Content
- **Real-world use cases** for each coroutine type
- **Color-coded explanations** with practical examples
- **Code snippets** showing proper usage
- **Performance implications** and best practices

### 🔧 Coroutine Types Covered

| Coroutine Type | Purpose | Animation Shows |
|---------------|---------|-----------------|
| **🚀 launch { }** | Fire-and-forget tasks | Independent execution, no return value |
| **⚡ async { }** | Concurrent work with results | Deferred creation and await() |
| **🧊 Cold Flow** | On-demand data streams | Independent execution per collector |
| **📡 SharedFlow** | Event broadcasting | Hot emissions to multiple subscribers |
| **🔄 StateFlow** | State management | Current value holding, duplicate skipping |
| **📬 Channel** | Coroutine communication | Producer-consumer queuing |
| **🔄 withContext** | Thread switching | Context/dispatcher changes |
| **⚠️ runBlocking** | Blocking execution | Thread blocking (with warnings) |

## 🌐 Live Demo

**Option 1: NETLIFYs**
```
https://coroutine-playground.netlify.app/
```

**Option 2: Local Setup**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zekapp/coroutine-animation.git
   cd coroutine-animation
   ```

2. Open in browser:
   ```bash
   # Simply open index.html in your browser
   open index.html  # macOS
   # or
   start index.html # Windows
   # or
   xdg-open index.html # Linux
   ```

## 📖 How to Use

### 🎮 Controls
- **▶️ Start All Animations** - Run all coroutine demonstrations
- **🔄 Reset All** - Clear all animations and reset to initial state
- **🗑️ Clear Logs** - Clear the execution log panel
- **Click any card** - Run individual coroutine animation

### 📋 Understanding the Interface

1. **Animation Cards** - Each coroutine type has its own interactive card
2. **Status Badges** - Show current state (Idle, Running, Completed, etc.)
3. **Visualization Area** - Watch coroutines execute with visual elements
4. **Code Snippets** - See the actual Kotlin code for each pattern
5. **Real-time Logs** - Detailed timestamped execution logs
6. **Use Case Boxes** - Practical examples of when to use each type

### 🎯 Learning Path

1. **Start with launch { }** - Understand basic coroutine creation
2. **Try async { }** - Learn about concurrent execution with results
3. **Explore Cold Flow** - See how flows work for each collector
4. **Compare with SharedFlow** - Understand hot vs cold streams
5. **Examine StateFlow** - Learn state management patterns
6. **Understand Channel** - See producer-consumer communication
7. **Study withContext** - Learn thread switching
8. **Be cautious with runBlocking** - Understand when NOT to use it

## 💡 Real-World Examples

### 🧊 Cold Flow - Database Queries
```kotlin
// Each screen component gets fresh data
fun getUserPosts() = flow {
    emit(database.getUserPosts()) // Fresh query for each collector
}
```

### 📡 SharedFlow - Event Broadcasting
```kotlin
// Notify all screens when user logs in
val userLoginEvents = MutableSharedFlow<User>()
userLoginEvents.emit(currentUser) // All screens update
```

### 🔄 StateFlow - UI State Management
```kotlin
// App theme state shared across components
val themeState = MutableStateFlow(LightTheme)
themeState.value = DarkTheme // All UI components update
```

### 📬 Channel - Task Processing
```kotlin
// Background task queue
val taskQueue = Channel<DownloadTask>()
taskQueue.send(downloadTask) // Workers process one at a time
```

### 🔄 withContext - Thread Management
```kotlin
suspend fun loadUserData() {
    val userData = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
        networkService.fetchUser() // Network call on IO thread
    }
    withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {
        updateUI(userData) // UI update on Main thread
    }
}
```

## 🎨 Visual Elements

### 🎯 Status Indicators
- 🔵 **Idle** - Ready to start
- 🟢 **Running** - Currently executing (pulsing animation)
- 🟡 **Suspended** - Waiting or paused
- 🔵 **Completed** - Finished successfully
- 🔴 **Error** - Something went wrong

### 📊 Animation Elements
- **Circular emissions** - Data flowing through the system
- **Progress bars** - Show completion status
- **Thread indicators** - Highlight active threads
- **Queue visualizations** - Show buffered items
- **Collector tracks** - Display subscription paths
